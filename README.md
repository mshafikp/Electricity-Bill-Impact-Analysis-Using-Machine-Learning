The objective of this investigation is to assess the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in forecasting customer behaviour in response to increasing energy costs. The study was conducted utilizing two datasets provided by AENERGY. The first dataset comprises historical customer information and a label indicating whether the customer experienced difficulties in paying their energy bills in recent months. The second dataset comprises historical customer information and a numerical value representing the annual expenditure variation for each customer as a result of increased energy costs. The aim of the investigation is to use these datasets to train and evaluate machine learning models for the prediction of customer behaviour.
